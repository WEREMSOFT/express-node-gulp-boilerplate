# express-node-gulp-boilerplate
Base application to create webapps with nodeJS axpress and mongoDB


# Routes
All the routes are on the routes folder. All that you have to do is create a file(you can copy any example you want) and the index.js file will take care of include the route in the application.

Let's take as an example the file "orders.js", this file is a controller for the the localhost:3030/api/routes url. Returning a JSON to the caller.
